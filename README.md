# hello-world
Sleeping at the top nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly 'till you swat 'em.
But who am I to talk? 
I aint' shittin' roses,
We in the same picture but we all got different poses.
Now im lookin' in my rearview,
I see the wold in it.
I try to slow donw,
But I get rear ended.
Pause, like a red light I'm dead right.
Highway to heaven God do you see my headlights?
They say you don't know what you're doing 'till you stop doing it.
Well call me clueless 'cause I do this.
Attention all shooters,
I'm a shooting star.
Life is a course,
And I'm gonna shoot for par.
